                        <h3>Morning Mindfulness</h3>
                        <p>Start your day with just 5 minutes of mindfulness. Find a quiet spot, close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Notice how you feel without judging yourself. This small thing can make your whole day feel calmer.</p>

                            <strong>Try this:</strong> Use a meditation app or just count your breaths from 1 to 10, then start over.

                        <p>Your body and mind work better when you're hydrated. Keep a water bottle nearby and take small sips all day. Every glass counts!</p>
                        <div class="tip-box">
                            <strong>Pro tip:</strong> Set reminders on your phone or add fruits like lemon or cucumber to make water more enjoyable.

                        <h3>Daily Gratitude</h3>
                        <p>Write down one good thing about yourself or your day. It could be something you did, a moment you liked, or something you like about yourself. Doing this helps you feel better over time.</p>

                            <strong>Make it easy:</strong> Keep a small notebook by your bed or use a notes app on your phone.

                        <h3>Get Some Sunlight</h3>
                        <p>Try to spend at least 10-15 minutes outside in natural light each day. Sunlight helps your mood and sleep. Even a quick walk around the block helps.</p>
                        <div class="tip-box">
                            <strong>Easy way:</strong> Eat breakfast near a window, take a phone call outside, or walk to school instead of driving.

                        <p>Good sleep is super important for your mental health. Try to get 8-10 hours each night. Make a bedtime routine that helps you chill out. Maybe read, stretch a little, or listen to some calm music.</p>
                        <div class="tip-box">
                            <strong>Sleep tip:</strong> Turn off screens an hour before bed and keep your room cool and dark.

                        <h3>Creative Expression</h3>
                        <p>Find something creative that makes you happy. Drawing, writing, music, dancing, or making stuff. You don't need to be good at it. Just doing it helps you feel better.</p>

                            <strong>Start small:</strong> Doodle in a notebook, write a short poem, or sing along to your favorite songs.
